1.Currently it’s ridiculously easy to rob banks. Banks almost universally have a “compliance” policy. So, you walk in, pick a teller, pass a note or just say that you have a weapon and want money. The teller will give you a certain amount and then you leave.

2.Of course, you won’t get much and your photo and video footage of you in high-resolution will go out to all law enforcement agencies and the FBI and almost invariably should you continue this activity you will end up in federal prison.

3.At worst, your ill-gotten gains may include an explosive dye-pack which will make you look very funny indeed.

4.Conducting a profitable, large-scale bank robbery requires a number of people, considerable research and effort, and the real threat of violence, and will be met by a much larger and more concerted law enforcement effort to track you down. The more people you involve in your effort the more likely it is that one will be caught and will plea-bargain away the rest of you….. This happens time and again.

5.The problem most robbers have is that they are terrible creatures of habit. They do the same thing over and over again, and that’s how they get caught.

6.Years ago, when I was just starting out, we had a bank robber who would always steal a car the night before his bank robbery, and he always stole the same make and model…. I guess he knew how to steal those.

7.So, working with the FBI, we simply waited for such a car to be reported stolen and then proceeded to stake out all the area banks…. Sure enough, junior walked in and was promptly arrested.
